# Neural Networks Intuition and Building a simple Image Classifier

Throughout these Google Colaboratory notebooks I have created an explanation about the main conceptions behind the Deep Learning and Neural Networks. 
Firsly, I used some pretrained models VGG19 and Inception-ResNetv2 for simple image classification with Keras.
In addition, I have build a neural network (multilayer perceptron) for image classification using CIFAR10 dataset for testing.

=) I am working in multiple projects, sorry for the simplified ReadME (I know..I need some "CSS3" for my repositories). Detailed description with "CSS3" is coming soon =)
