# Neural Networks Intuition and Building a simple Image Classifier

In this Google Colaboratory notebooks I have a explanation about the main conceptios behind the Deep Learning and Neural Networks. 
Firsly, I used some pretrained models VGG19 and Inception-ResNetv2 for simple image classification with Keras.
In addition, I have build a neural network (multilayer perceptron) for image classification using CIFAR10 dataset for testing.

=) I am working in multiple projects, sorry for the simplified ReadME. Detailed description is coming soon =)
